# Picard
We offer an easy way for people to browse our NFTs in our Picard app. In China, people can’t use Opensea unless they have VPN on their phones. We’d like to connect to the metadata and show them on our server. By doing so, our users could access to our collections (We have two by now.) by merely sliding up like Tiktok. If they want to buy them, we’ll redirect them to Opensea.
